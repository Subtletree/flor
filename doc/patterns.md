## introduction

The Workflow Patterns are a catalog of various building blocks for workflow execution.

Described here are ways to implement each of those patterns with flor. Some of them are not directly realizable with flor, approximations are proposed. This is a self-evaluation, for an authoritative voice, the workflow patterns website and its mailing list are here.

Each pattern is illustrated with a flor implementation (or approximation). There is a link to the original pattern explanation and its flash animation.
